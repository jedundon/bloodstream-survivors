# Quick Setup Guide for GitHub Task Management

## Step 1: Create Milestones (5 minutes)
Go to Issues → Milestones → New milestone:

1. **Alpha 1 - Core Mechanics** (Due: +3 weeks)
2. **Alpha 2 - Progression System** (Due: +6 weeks)  
3. **Alpha 3 - Full Weapon Set + UI** (Due: +10 weeks)
4. **Alpha 4 - Enemy Variety + Bosses** (Due: +14 weeks)
5. **Alpha 5 - Polish + Meta-progression** (Due: +19 weeks)

## Step 2: Create Issues (15 minutes)

- `alpha-2-5-issues.md` (15+ issues)

For each issue:
1. Use "Feature Implementation" template
2. Fill in component area and alpha build
3. Assign to appropriate milestone
4. Add priority label

## Step 3: Set Up Project Board (10 minutes)
Follow instructions in `project-board-setup.md`

## Step 4: Your Junior Developer Starts Here
Point them to:
1. `development-workflow.md` - Complete workflow guide
2. GitHub Project board - Current task status
3. Alpha 1 milestone - First set of tasks to tackle

## Ready to Begin!
Your junior developer now has:
- ✅ 25+ well-defined, testable tasks
- ✅ Clear alpha build progression
